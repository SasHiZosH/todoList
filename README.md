**Hello everyone**

So this is another project of mine using React.js.<br>
It's a simple Todo List where you can add, edit and delete items.<br>
Although the responsive isn't done **yet**, I felt like sharing it so I can keep
track of my progress.<br>

I used **react hooks** and **styled components** to make this simple arcade themed app.
